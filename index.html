          Before we dive into the 8 types of graphic design, let’s start with the basics: What is graphic design? Graphic design is the creation of visual compositions to solve problems and communicate ideas through typography, imagery, color and form.

          Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.
